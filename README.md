An updated version of the Creatures Docking Station world switcher frontend, featuring custom world icons, a custom icon pixel art tool, and a checkbox system for what to dock with your world rather than the classic awkward button.

You can install it by putting all the files in the root of your "Creatures Docking Station\Docking Station\" directory.
